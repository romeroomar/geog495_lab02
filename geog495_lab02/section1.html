        his parents divorced and he ended up moving with him mom to Chicago, Illinois. 
        His father, Ray West, is a former black panther which Ye has mentioned many 
        times before and later became a Christian counselor. His mother, Dr. Donda C. West,

        It is said that Ye had a likeness for the arts at a very young age. His mother 
        recalled that she first took notice of West's passion for drawing and music when he 
        was in the third grade. After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship 
        to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes. 
        Shortly after, he transferred to Chicago State University to study English. There was 
        a conflict with his busy schedule and the time he had to make music so he ended up 
        dropping out of college in order to pursue his musical dreams.</span></p>
